# Simple Shell
In this repo we create a simple shell.

# Motivation
This is our end of end of semester and second partner project for Holberton School.  Over the last three months we have been learning C basics. In this repo we bring everything we have learned together and create a simple shell.

# Environment
Our simple Shell is built and tested in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and compiled with GCC 4.8.4

# How to Use?
Launch the shell with ./hsh and enter a command.<br/>
Example output:<br/>
```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:$ ./hsh
$ pwd
/home/vagrant/simple_shell
$ ls
pathfinder.c  README.md  shell  shell.h  shell_helpers.c  simple_shell.c
```
<br/>
# How to Complie:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
